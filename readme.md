# Example Usage: Spring Authorization Server, Spring Resource Server, Angular with OIDC Client

This project demonstrates how to integrate an Angular application with a Spring-based backend, utilizing OAuth2 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication and authorization. The setup includes:

- **Spring Authorization Server**: Handles the authorization logic and issues access tokens.
- **Spring Resource Server**: Protects resources and validates access tokens.
- **Angular with OIDC Client**: A frontend application that authenticates users and interacts with protected backend resources.
